## No-show appointments

### Objective
In this project i will be analysing the data above and try to finding trends amongst patients who showed up for thier medical appointments and how it differs from those who didn't


### Dataset Description
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

- 'ScheduledDay' - tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
- 'Neighborhood' - indicates the location of the hospital.
- 'Scholarship' - indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Fam√≠lia.
- 'PatientId' - Identification of a patient
- 'AppointmentID' - Identification of each appointment
- 'Gender' - Male or Female . Female is the greater proportion, woman takes way more care of they health in comparison to man.
- 'Age' - How old is the patient.
- 'Neighbourhood' - Where the appointment takes place.
- 'Scholarship' - True of False . Observation, this is a broad topic, consider reading this article
- 'Hypertension' - True or False. tells us whether the patient has hypertension or not
- 'Diabetes' - True or False. tells us whether the patient has diabetes or not
- 'Alcoholism' - True or False. tells us whether the patient is into alcohol or not

- 'SMS_received' - 1 or more messages sent to the patient.
- 'No-show' - True or False. tells us whether the patient showed up for the medical appointment or not

### Question(s) for Analysis
1. What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?
2. What is the distribution of patients who showed up by different age groups?
3. Which neighbourhood are the patients mostly from?
4. How many patients who have diabetes are also into alcohol
5. What is the mean age of patients who showed up and patients who did not show up for thier appointments?
6. What is the mean age of patients who have hypertension?
7. What is the mean age of patients who received scholarship?
8. What is the mean age of patients who have diabetes?

### Conclusions
1. From the histogram plots, it was difficult to determine the factors that could be considered to predict if a patient would show up for a scheduled appointment although my findings from them are as follows:
  - Gender: Close half of the total number of patients (57245) who showed up for thier appointments were of female gender
  - Scholarship: About 80,000 patients who showed up for their appointsments didn't recieve a scholarship
  - Teen and Older age group: Majority of patients who showed up for their appointments where in this age categories
2. It was found that majority of the patients came from the 'JARDIM CAMBURI' neighbourhood
3. 4.18% of patients who have diabetes also are also into alcoholism
4. The mean age of patients who showed up and patients who did not show up for thier appointments was found to be 38 and 34 years respectively
5. The mean age of patients who have hypertension is about 61 years
6.The mean age of patients who received scholarships is about 31 years, meaning the younger patients are more likely to recieve scholarships
7. Thee mean age of patients who have diabetes is about 61 years
